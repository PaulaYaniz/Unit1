## Vertices of rectangle
Given integer coordinates of three vertices of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the rectangle. In the first test the three given vertices are (1, 4), (1, 6), (7, 4). The fourth vertex is thus (7, 6).

## White pawn move
A white chess pawn moves up vertically one square at a time. An exception is a pawn on a row #2: it can move either one or two squares up. In addition, a white chess pawn captures diagonally up one square to the left or right. A white chess pawn can never occur on a row #1.

The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first square, and then the last two - for the second square. The program should print YES if a white pawn can possibly move from the first square to the second square in one move in some game - either by move or by capture. The program should print NO otherwise. The first four tests correspond to the green arrows on the picture below.
