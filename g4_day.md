### How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?

An adult lives a medium of 75 years. They usually have memories from all his life, but a lot of them (mostly in childhood) are hidden and hard to remember.

Each day has 24 hours, but you only spend woken up 16h. Then, you do a lot of things that you then forget, and you also spend a lot of hours doing things you won't remember because you do them unconsciously (watching social media, TV, going to the bathroom, etc.).
This means that from each day you may remember vaguely 10 hours and only 2 hours of conscious and intense learning. 

Now, we should know how much storage space a memory takes.
If the learning was vague, the memory will not take that much space. 10 hours of vague memories a day would be 2gb a day, or 730gb a year.
Then, the 2 hours of conscious and important learning a day would be 4gb a day, or 1,460gb a year.

In total, this is 2,190gb a year. If you live 75 years, that would be a total of **164,250gb** of human memories, in **41,063** USBs of 4gb.

Of course, this is not exact. There may be years in which you learn and get more core memories than others, but this would be a balance.

Another important thing is that if the human body was a computer, the core memories should be stored in a hard disk, and for more security backed up in an online cloud.
